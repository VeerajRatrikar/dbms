a) Find the names of all Juniors (level = JR) who are enrolled in a class taught by Rakesh. 
Select Distinct S.Snum, S.Sname from Student S,Class C, Enrolled E,Faculty F where S.Snum =
E.Snum and E.Cname = C.Cname and C.Fid = F.Fid and F.Fname = 'Rakesh' and S.Lev = 'JR' order by
Snum;

b) Find the age of the oldest student who is either a history major or enrolled in a course taught by Ravi.
Select MAX(S.age) as Age from Student S where (S.Major = 'History') OR S.Snum in (Select E.Snum
from Class C , Enrolled E, Faculty F where E.cname = C.cname and C.Fid = F.Fid and F.Fname =

c) Find the names of all students who are enrolled in two classes that meet at the same time.
Select Distinct S.Sname from Student S where S.Snum in (Select E1.Snum from Enrolled
E1,Enrolled E2, Class C1, Class C2 where E1.snum = E2.snum and E1.cname <> E2.cname and

d) For each faculty member that has taught classes only in room R128, print the faculty memberâ€™s name and the total number of classes she or he has taught. 
Select Distinct F.Fname , count(*) as CourseCount from CLass C , Faculty F where C.FID not in
(Select Fid from Class where Room IN (Select Room from Class where Room!= 'R128')) AND C.Fid =

e) Create a view that contains the details of students along with the name of the courses enrolled
